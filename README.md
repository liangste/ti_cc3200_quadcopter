# cc3200 quadcopter
a small quadcopter based on TI [CC3200](http://www.ti.com/product/cc3200) Wifi Processor

This is a project I started to develop a small quadcopter that I can control through my smartphone. It began as the idea: "wouldn't it be cool to fly a quadcopter with my phone?". Soon after, I got a development board for the CC3200 platform and I enrolled on a year-long journey of hw/sw development.

Most "cotrol" related components are routed to the top of the PCB.

While "Power" related components are routed to the bottom.
