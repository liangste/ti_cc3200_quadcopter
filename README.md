This is a project I started to develop a small quadcopter that I can control through my smartphone. It began as the idea: "wouldn't it be cool to fly a quadcopter with my phone?". Soon after, I got a development board for the CC3200 platform and I enrolled on a year-long journey of hw/sw development.

Here's a video of it flying:
